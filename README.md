# LEGO Price Analysis Report

This quantitative LEGO price analysis report investigates the relationship between LEGO set prices and the number of pieces in the set or the set's theme. The report was the deliverable for the final group project of SDS 201: Statistical Methods for Undergraduates at Smith College. 

The report was created by using R within a Quarto document, which is a document format application that generates documents of various programming languages. RStudio was the IDE used to generate the report.
